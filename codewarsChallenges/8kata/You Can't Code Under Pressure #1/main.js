//Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.

function doubleInteger(i) {
    // i will be an integer. Double it and return it.
    //PREP
    //Parameters: i, an interger
    //Return: i, doubled
    //Examples: i = 2, should return 4; i = 4, should return 8
    //Pseudocode: i = i * 2, return i
    return i * 2;
